\description{
Wraps an \link{Objective} function with extra services for convenient evaluation.
\itemize{
\item Automatic storing of results in an \link{Archive} after evaluation.
\item Automatic checking for termination. Evaluations of design points are performed in batches.
Before a batch is evaluated, the \link{Terminator} is queried for the remaining budget.
If the available budget is exhausted, an exception is raised, and no further evaluations can be performed from this point on.
\item Logging of evaluations on R console
\item Encapsulated evaluation via evaluate / callr with function \code{\link[mlr3misc:encapsulate]{mlr3misc::encapsulate()}}
to guard against exceptions and even segfaults.
Note that behavior is define in \link{Objective} argument \code{encapsulate}.
}

Creates a new instance of this \link[R6:R6Class]{R6} class.

Evaluates all hyperparameter configurations in \code{dt} through
resampling, where each configuration is a row, and columns are scalar
parameters. eturns a named list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{"batch_nr"}: Number of the new batch. This number is calculated in an
auto-increment fashion.
\item \code{"perf"}: A \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table()}} of
evaluated performances for each row of the \code{dt}. Has the same number
of rows as \code{dt}, and the same number of columns as length of
\code{measures}. Columns are named with measure-IDs. A cell entry is the
(aggregated) performance of that configuration for that measure.
}

Before each batch-evaluation, the \link{Terminator} is checked, and if it
is positive, an exception of class \code{terminated_error} is raised. This
function should be internally called by the tuner.

The \link{Optimizer} object writes the best found point
and estimated performance values here. For internal use.
